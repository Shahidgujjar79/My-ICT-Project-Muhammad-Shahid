            <h2> Markhor: The National Animal of Pakistan</h2>
            <p>The markhor is a wild goat species that belongs to Central and South Asia, primarily found in the mountainous regions of Pakistan and Afghanistan. It is listed as "Near Threatened" because of habitat loss, overhunting for meat and trophies, and competition with livestock, which have greatly reduced its population.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-title">Important Details about Markhor:</div>

        <div class="content">
            <p><strong>Scientific Classification:</strong> The markhor is scientifically known as <em>Capra falconeri</em>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <p><strong>Habitat:</strong> This species inhabits mountainous regions across Central and South Asia, including Afghanistan, India, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. The species is adapted to elevations between 600 and 3,600 meters, thriving in open woodlands, scrublands, and light forests.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <p><strong>Physical Characteristics:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The markhor has long, corkscrew-shaped horns that can grow up to 63 inches (160 cm).</li>
                <li>Males typically stand about 95–102 cm (37–40 inches) at the shoulder.</li>
                <li>Its coat varies seasonally: reddish-brown in summer, and long, gray, and silky in winter.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <p><strong>Population Status:</strong> The mature population of markhor is estimated at around 5,700 individuals globally. All subspecies are considered endangered to critically endangered.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <p><strong>Cultural Significance:</strong> The markhor is the national animal of Pakistan and holds significant ecological importance in its native habitat.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-title">Reasons for Endangerment:</div>

        <div class="content">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Habitat Loss:</strong> The markhor has been affected by the destruction of natural habitats caused by human activities, such as deforestation and land development.</li>
                <li><strong>Illegal Hunting and Poaching:</strong> Overhunting for meat and trophies has significantly reduced their population. Markhors are particularly hunted for their magnificent horns.</li>
                <li><strong>Competition with Livestock:</strong> Livestock's invasion into markhor habitats has caused competition for food and resources, which poses an additional threat to their survival.</li>
                <li><strong>Climate Change:</strong> Changes in climate patterns are affecting the markhor's habitats, impacting their food sources and stable habitats.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section-title">Conservation Measures:</div>

        <div class="content">
            <p>The markhor species is listed under the IUCN Red List and is protected under many international agreements such as CITES.</p>
            <p>The main focus of conservation efforts lies in preserving the habitat, conducting anti-poaching activities, and promoting responsible tourism. These efforts aim to stimulate the local economy while minimizing harm to the species.</p>

        <div class="section-title"><h3 style="color: black;">Snow Leopard: The Ghost of the Mountains</h3></div>

        <div class="content">
            <p>The snow leopard (<em>Panthera uncia</em>), often referred to as the "ghost of the mountains," is a large cat native to the rugged mountain ranges of Central and South Asia, including the Himalayas, the Tibetan Plateau, and parts of Mongolia and Russia. These elusive creatures are well-adapted to their cold, mountainous habitats, with thick fur, long tails, and large paws that act like snowshoes, allowing them to traverse steep and snowy terrain. Snow leopards typically weigh between 60 to 120 pounds and have a body length of about 3 to 4.5 feet, with tails that can be as long as 2 to 3 feet. Their striking grayish-white fur is patterned with black rosettes and spots, providing excellent camouflage against the rocky landscape.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-title">Conservation Status:</div>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Despite their adaptability, snow leopards are classified as "Vulnerable" on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, with an estimated population of only 4,000 to 6,500 individuals remaining in the wild. Several factors contribute to their endangered status.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-title">Threats to Survival:</div>

        <div class="content">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Habitat Loss:</strong> Habitat loss due to climate change, mining, and infrastructure development has significantly reduced their living space.</li>
                <li><strong>Poaching:</strong> Poaching poses a severe threat, as snow leopards are hunted for their beautiful pelts and body parts, which are sold in illegal wildlife markets.</li>
                <li><strong>Human-Wildlife Conflict:</strong> Human-wildlife conflict is another critical issue, as snow leopards often prey on livestock, leading to retaliatory killings by herders.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section-title">Conservation Efforts:</div>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Conservation efforts are underway to protect these magnificent animals, including community-based programs that promote coexistence between local communities and snow leopards. These initiatives aim to reduce livestock losses through better husbandry practices and compensation schemes for herders. Protecting snow leopards is essential not only for their survival but also for maintaining the ecological balance in their mountainous habitats, where they play a crucial role as apex predators.</p>
